# Example Data Source

These **A25.mutect2** files comes from a deep (74x) bulk sequencing dataset containing the somatic mutations of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [[link](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1519556112)]. This data has been filtered to a subset of consequential SNPs.

The filtered VCF was annotated with the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). [[link](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html)]
